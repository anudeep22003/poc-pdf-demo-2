response from query: Response 1: To perform an occlusal scan, start by positioning the scanner in the starting position on the tooth closest to the prepared tooth in the distal direction. Then, scan in the mesial direction, moving the scanner occlusally from the distal tooth over the prepared tooth to the mesial tooth. It is important to ensure that the coated sapphire disc of the scanner is at a distance of 0-20mm from the surface being measured, with the optimal distance being 2mm. The scanner should not rest on the teeth or the gums.

Note that cutting and scoring should be from the back side of the panels.\nExamine and inspect framing materials to which gypsum panels are to be applied. Remedy all defects prior to installation of the gypsum board.\nCaution: Because this product contains fiberglass, dust and glass fibers may be released during normal handling, which could result in eye or skin irritation or cause difficulty in breathing. Wherever possible, avoid contact with the skin and eyes and avoid breathing dust or fibers that may be released during installation. Consult the SDS for this product, available at: goldbondbuilding.com before use.\nFASTENING\nApply gypsum panels first to ceilings at right angles to framing members, then to walls. Use boards of maximum practical length so that the minimum number of end joints occur. Bring panel edges into contact with each other but do not force into place.\nInstall batt or blanket ceiling insulation BEFORE the gypsum panels on ceilings when installing a vapor retarder behind the gypsum panels. Install the insulation IMMEDIATELY after the gypsum panels when using loose fill insulation. Avoid installation practices that might allow condensation to form behind panels.\neXP® Sheathing® – Fasteners (nail or screw heads or the crown of staples) should bear tightly against the face of the sheathing panel but should not cut into the facer. Staples should be driven with the crown parallel to the framing. Fasteners should be no less than 3/8” (9.5 mm) from the edges and ends of the panel. When shear values are not required, fasteners should be spaced not more than 8” (203 mm) o.c. along the vertical ends or edges and intermediate supports.\nNails\nLocate gypsum panel joints at openings so that no joint will occur within 12” (305 mm) of the edges of the opening unless installing control joints at these locations. Stagger vertical end joints. Joints on opposite sides of a partition should not occur on the same stud.\nHold gypsum panels in firm contact with the framing member while driving fasteners. Fastening should proceed from center portion of the panels toward the edges and ends. Set fasteners with heads slightly below the surface of the panels. Take care to avoid breaking the fiberglass mat of the gypsum panel. Remove improperly driven nails or screws.\nGalvanized, 11 gauge\n7/16” (11.1 mm) head, 1-1/2” (38.1 mm) long for 1/2” (12.7 mm) sheathing\n1-3/4” (44.5 mm) long for 5/8” (15.9 mm) sheathing\nStaples\nGalvanized 16 gauge, 7/16” (11.1 mm) crown, 1-1/2” (38.1 mm) long for 1/2” (12.7 mm) sheathing\nProvide minimum 1/4” (6.4 mm) clearance between boards and adjacent concrete or masonry to minimize wicking of moisture.\n1-5/8” (41.3 mm) long for 5/8 in (15.9 mm) sheathing\nMaintain a room temperature of not less than 40˚F (4˚C) during application of gypsum panels.\nScrews\nASTM C1002 or ASTM C954\nSAFETY\n1-1/4” (31.8 mm) long Type W for wood framing\nInstallers should wear long pants and a long-sleeved, loose-fitting shirt. Use protective gloves and special eye protection (goggles or safety glasses with side shield). Wear a dust mask when sanding; you may need additional breathing protection in extremely dusty conditions. Do not use a power saw to cut this product.\n1” (25.4 mm) long Type S-12 for metal framing\nFIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS\nFire-resistance ratings represent the results of tests on assemblies made up of specific materials in a specific configuration. When you are selecting construction designs to meet certain fire-resistance requirements, use caution to ensure that each component of the assembly is specified in the test.

IR is designed for a non-paper faced gypsum application and anywhere impact penetration and heavy traffic is a concern. It utilizes coated fiberglass facers, along with a specially formulated fiberglass mesh embedded into the gypsum core. IR provides a high level of surface-impact resistance. When you think about eXP Interior Extreme IR, think the toughest board in the series.\neXP Interior Extreme IR has the features you’re already familiar with in our Interior Extreme and Interior Extreme AR products. This flexible substrate works well for both wood- and metal-framed construction. Approved for specific UL fire-rated designs, it has also achieved UL GREENGUARD Gold Certification. UL GREENGUARD Certified products are certified to UL GREENGUARD standards for low chemical emissions into indoor air during product usage.

Fiberglass Mesh\nAPPLICATIONS\nGold Bond® eXP® Interior Extreme® IR Gypsum Panels consist of an impact-resistant and a moisture- and mold-resistant gypsum core encased in a coated, specially designed glass mat on the face, back and sides. In addition to moisture and mold resistance, the impact- resistant panel has a denser core and an enhanced glass mat for increased resistance to indentation and impact. Additionally, the fiberglass mesh embedded into the core enhances impact resistance. It is available in a Type X core. The glass mat is folded around the long edges to reinforce and protect the core.\nUse it for interior applications requiring increased resistance to incidental moisture and wall penetrations. It is ideal for areas prone to cavity penetration, including gymnasiums, correctional facilities, schools and workshops.\nSizes: 5/8” (15.9 mm) Type X panels are available in 4’ (1,219 mm) nominal widths and standard lengths of 8’ (2,438 mm) to 12’ (3,658 mm).\nFinishing: Perform finishing of eXP panels in accordance with GA-214.

Note that cutting and scoring should be from the back side of the panels.\nExamine and inspect framing materials to which gypsum panels are to be applied. Remedy all defects prior to installation of the gypsum board.\nCaution: Because this product contains fiberglass, dust and glass fibers may be released during normal handling, which could result in eye or skin irritation or cause difficulty in breathing. Wherever possible, avoid contact with the skin and eyes and avoid breathing dust or fibers that may be released during installation. Consult the SDS for this product, available at: goldbondbuilding.com before use.\nFASTENING\nApply gypsum panels first to ceilings at right angles to framing members, then to walls. Use boards of maximum practical length so that the minimum number of end joints occur. Bring panel edges into contact with each other but do not force into place.\nInstall batt or blanket ceiling insulation BEFORE the gypsum panels on ceilings when installing a vapor retarder behind the gypsum panels. Install the insulation IMMEDIATELY after the gypsum panels when using loose fill insulation. Avoid installation practices that might allow condensation to form behind panels.\neXP® Sheathing® – Fasteners (nail or screw heads or the crown of staples) should bear tightly against the face of the sheathing panel but should not cut into the facer. Staples should be driven with the crown parallel to the framing. Fasteners should be no less than 3/8” (9.5 mm) from the edges and ends of the panel. When shear values are not required, fasteners should be spaced not more than 8” (203 mm) o.c. along the vertical ends or edges and intermediate supports.\nNails\nLocate gypsum panel joints at openings so that no joint will occur within 12” (305 mm) of the edges of the opening unless installing control joints at these locations. Stagger vertical end joints. Joints on opposite sides of a partition should not occur on the same stud.\nHold gypsum panels in firm contact with the framing member while driving fasteners. Fastening should proceed from center portion of the panels toward the edges and ends. Set fasteners with heads slightly below the surface of the panels. Take care to avoid breaking the fiberglass mat of the gypsum panel. Remove improperly driven nails or screws.\nGalvanized, 11 gauge\n7/16” (11.1 mm) head, 1-1/2” (38.1 mm) long for 1/2” (12.7 mm) sheathing\n1-3/4” (44.5 mm) long for 5/8” (15.9 mm) sheathing\nStaples\nGalvanized 16 gauge, 7/16” (11.1 mm) crown, 1-1/2” (38.1 mm) long for 1/2” (12.7 mm) sheathing\nProvide minimum 1/4” (6.4 mm) clearance between boards and adjacent concrete or masonry to minimize wicking of moisture.\n1-5/8” (41.3 mm) long for 5/8 in (15.9 mm) sheathing\nMaintain a room temperature of not less than 40˚F (4˚C) during application of gypsum panels.\nScrews\nASTM C1002 or ASTM C954\nSAFETY\n1-1/4” (31.8 mm) long Type W for wood framing\nInstallers should wear long pants and a long-sleeved, loose-fitting shirt.

Note that cutting and scoring should be from the back side of the panels.\nExamine and inspect framing materials to which gypsum panels are to be applied. Remedy all defects prior to installation of the gypsum board.\nCaution: Because this product contains fiberglass, dust and glass fibers may be released during normal handling, which could result in eye or skin irritation or cause difficulty in breathing. Wherever possible, avoid contact with the skin and eyes and avoid breathing dust or fibers that may be released during installation. Consult the SDS for this product, available at: goldbondbuilding.com before use.\nFASTENING\nApply gypsum panels first to ceilings at right angles to framing members, then to walls. Use boards of maximum practical length so that the minimum number of end joints occur. Bring panel edges into contact with each other but do not force into place.\nInstall batt or blanket ceiling insulation BEFORE the gypsum panels on ceilings when installing a vapor retarder behind the gypsum panels. Install the insulation IMMEDIATELY after the gypsum panels when using loose fill insulation. Avoid installation practices that might allow condensation to form behind panels.\neXP® Sheathing® – Fasteners (nail or screw heads or the crown of staples) should bear tightly against the face of the sheathing panel but should not cut into the facer. Staples should be driven with the crown parallel to the framing. Fasteners should be no less than 3/8” (9.5 mm) from the edges and ends of the panel. When shear values are not required, fasteners should be spaced not more than 8” (203 mm) o.c. along the vertical ends or edges and intermediate supports.\nNails\nLocate gypsum panel joints at openings so that no joint will occur within 12” (305 mm) of the edges of the opening unless installing control joints at these locations. Stagger vertical end joints. Joints on opposite sides of a partition should not occur on the same stud.\nHold gypsum panels in firm contact with the framing member while driving fasteners. Fastening should proceed from center portion of the panels toward the edges and ends. Set fasteners with heads slightly below the surface of the panels.

It is specifically designed for use in showers, bathrooms, indoor swimming pools, laundry rooms, and kitchens. The Tile Backer is manufactured with an enhanced moisture- and mold-resistant core encased in specially designed coated glass mat facers. The facer is then coated with a specially formulated acrylic coating, which provides superior protection against moisture and humidity. It serves as an integral water barrier, eliminating the need for a separate water barrier. The Tile Backer is available in 1/2" (12.7 mm) thickness and 4' (1,219 mm) nominal width, and comes in 8' (2,438 mm) lengths. It is also available in a 5/8" (15.9 mm) thickness for fire-rated assemblies. The Tile Backer is code-compliant for both wet and non-wet areas, areas of high humidity, and fire-rated assemblies. It is suitable for interior walls and ceilings.
