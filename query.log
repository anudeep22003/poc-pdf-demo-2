Give me details about the Tile Backer?
{'content': 'Response 1: The Tile Backer is a product called eXP® Tile Backer, which is a moisture- and mold-resistant gypsum panel designed for use as a substrate for tile applications in high moisture areas. It is specifically designed for use in showers, bathrooms, indoor swimming pools, laundry rooms, and kitchens. The Tile Backer is manufactured with an enhanced moisture- and mold-resistant core encased in specially designed coated glass mat facers. The facer is then coated with a specially formulated acrylic coating, which provides superior protection against moisture and humidity. It serves as an integral water barrier, eliminating the need for a separate water barrier. The Tile Backer is available in 1/2" (12.7 mm) thickness and 4\' (1,219 mm) nominal width, and comes in 8\' (2,438 mm) lengths. It is also available in a 5/8" (15.9 mm) thickness for fire-rated assemblies. The Tile Backer is code-compliant for both wet and non-wet areas, areas of high humidity, and fire-rated assemblies. It is suitable for interior walls and ceilings.', 'sources': '6, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 34'}
